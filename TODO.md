## List of features that would be nice to have

- Service mode instead of scheduler
  - Windows service
  - Included scheduler that does schedule backups and upgrades, no need for an upgrade counter file anymore
- Fallback for upgrade server
- Rewrite prometheus push server requests to have fallback option, to use requestor
- Cube qemu plugin
- Fallback server when primary repo is not available
- Windows installer (NSIS ?)
- Linux installer script
- Having wrong repo password should trigger a GUI error
